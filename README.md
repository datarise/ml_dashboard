# ml_dashboard
This is a fun little dashboard that is made with Streamlit and Sklearn. It can show how desicion bounderies compare between different ML models and how a desicion boundery changes when the parameters of the model are updated. It is possible to upload your own data in a csv and try it out aswell(It is a little buggy for now :/)

The dashboard is deployed at Streamlit here: https://share.streamlit.io/datarise/ml_dashboard/dashboard.py

Feel free to play around with it.

Small note - It is my first Github project and I am just figuring it out.
